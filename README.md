# Multimodal Mortality Prediction in COVID-19

This repository contains the necessary code and instructions to reproduce the experiments described in the paper:

*"Developing and Validating Multi-Modal Models for Mortality Prediction in COVID-19 Patients: a Multi-center Retrospective Study"*

The paper investigates the use of multi-modal models to predict mortality in COVID-19 patients, leveraging various data sources.

# Note on Code

The original code for these experiments, which serves as the basis for this repository, can be downloaded directly from its source:

# Note on Data

The experiments provided in this repository are not conducted with the original data directly from the paper. Instead, they utilize the publicly available*COVID-19 Data Shared Learning (CDSL) dataset from PhysioNet, which can be accessed here:

## Getting Started

To set up your environment and run the experiments, please refer to the `CONFIGURE.md` file within this repository. It provides detailed instructions on installing the required Python version and libraries to ensure a smooth and error-free execution of the code.
